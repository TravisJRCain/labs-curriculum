# Module Inquiry 1

## Questions

1. What questions did you ask your stakeholder that helped in breaking down your tasks?
    - As a group, we asked 4 questions to our stakeholder. These questions included; "Is it up to us to determine what statistics to show, or are there set ones you (the stakeholder) wants?", "Requirements for cities to be included? are we also including greater areas/ are larger cities split up", "Do you have any data for us or any sources/ is there an existing codebase", and "Is there a preference for how the data is displayed to the user?"
2. What user stories did you draw from to create your product roadmap? List them below.
    - Users should be able to view JSON endpoints of a city's statistics. Users should be able to compare cities based on weather, job growth rate, rent prices and see visualizations of the comparisons.
3. Select your favorite user story. What are the tasks that need to be accomplished in order to ship that particular user story?
    - My favorite user story is that users should be able to compare cities based on rent prices. In order to accomplish this, the DS and Web teams must work together to access the relevant data and visualize the important outcomes.
        - What did you do well in this task breakdown process? What were some challenges?
            - I feel as though the team did a great job of understanding what our goals wanted to be and touch on how to go about finishing these goals.
4. After what you've learned in this process, given a new product roadmap, how would you approach it differently? What would you change about the way you go about breaking down individual tasks?
    - I think our group did a great job of laying out a plan and structure of what we want to do. We could maybe discuss which variables (weather, job growth, etc.) are the most important to us.
